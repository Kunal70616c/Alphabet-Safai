**Developed "Alphabet Safari" at IBM Internship**

* **Live Website:** https://alphabetsafari.surge.sh/

"Alphabet Safari" is an educational website I created during my internship at IBM. This interactive platform caters to young children, providing a fun and engaging way to learn the alphabet. 

**Website Content:**

* Interactive elements to keep children engaged.
* Educational content aligned with early learning goals.
* Visually appealing design to capture children's attention.

This project allowed me to apply front-end development skills in a real-world context, focusing on creating a user-friendly and educational experience for young learners.
